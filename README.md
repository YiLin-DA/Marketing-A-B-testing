Project Background
An impression bidding model, in the context of online advertising and digital marketing, refers to the strategy used by advertisers and advertising platforms to determine how much they are willing to pay to have their ad displayed to a specific user when that user visits a website or application. This process is fundamental to the purchase of online advertising space and the optimization of advertising campaigns. Given the previous information, the case of a company is presented as follows.

An advertising technology company recently introduced a new impression bidding model for their online advertising campaigns, Average Bidding, as an alternative to their existing bidding model, Maximum Bidding. The project aims to conduct an A/B test to understand if Average Bidding performs better than Maximum Bidding.

The company has tested for a month, measuring a set of specific metrics on a daily basis:

Meta data
Spend [USD] - The money spent.
Impressions - Number of times an ad appears in front of a user's sight.
Reach - Number of unique users who saw an ad.
Website Clicks - Number of clicks in the website link of the advertisement.
Searches - Number of searches performed on the website.
View Content - Number of times visitors watch the details of a product.
Add to Cart - Number of sessions where an item was added to the cart through the cart button.
Purchase - Number of times that customers make a purchase.
Now that we have all the data, the customer wants to know if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum bidding. Taking into account the variables that have been measured throughout the experiment, we can use the following metrics to find out which bidding model is better:

a) Cost Per Miles - Helps measure the cost of ads for exposure. CPM = (Spend [USD] / # of Impressions * 1000)

b) Cost Per Click (CPC) - It allows you to evaluate the efficiency of advertising expenses to generate clicks. CPC = (Spend [USD] / # of Website Clicks)

c) Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) - Refers to the average cost a company pays to acquire a new customer or a desired conversion, in this case it will be a purchase, through its marketing or advertising strategy. CPA = (Spend [USD] / # of Purchase)
